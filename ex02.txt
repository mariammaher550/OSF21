to increase hit ratio we can simply request same number of pages frequently and consectively 
, for example if we have 5 place sin page frame we request only 5 pages from memory and 
keep requesting them. Thus leading to increased hit ratio.

However, to increase miss ratio we can simply request all pages for example, 
if we have 5 places in page frame and 100 pages in total we can call all 100 pages in sequence 
in that way the miss ratio will increase.

#reasons that lead to change in hit/miss ratio
1- frequently calling specific pages in pages frame (high hit ratio)
2- calls different pages than what in page frame (high miss ratio)
